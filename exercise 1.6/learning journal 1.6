Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python

Learning Goals

●	Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

Reflection Questions

1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?
  A. Databases are orgnaized collections of data, they enable you to store, manage, and retrieve these collections from them. The advantages include data integrity, security, scalability and application access. 

2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:


Data type	       Definition

VARCHAR -        String of variable length, with n representing the maximum number of characters
INT -            Standard integers
FLOAT -          Floating-point decimal numbers
DATETIME -       Datetime values
	

3.	 In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?
  A. SQLite is great for situations where your application is small to medium sized and you want a lightweight database without a seperate server. It also is a good choice if your project doesnt require complex multi-user access control.

4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?
  A. So far I enjoy using Python much more, as something with the syntax structure has clicked with me.

5.	Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?
  A. I havent noticed any hard limitations in my experience thus far, but it appears that is not as useful for large scale projects as javascript is upon further research.
