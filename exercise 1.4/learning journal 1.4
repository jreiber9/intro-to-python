Exercise 1.4: File Handling in Python
Learning Goals

●	Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

Reflection Questions

1.	Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?

2.	In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 

3.	In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?

4.	Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?

5.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? Feel free to use these notes to guide your next mentor call.
