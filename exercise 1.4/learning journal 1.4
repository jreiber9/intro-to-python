Exercise 1.4: File Handling in Python
Learning Goals

●	Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

Reflection Questions

1.	Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?

  A. File storage is important when you are using python because typically when the script ends the data is wiped if it not stored. 

2.	In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 

  A. Pickles convert complex data into a packaged stream of bytes, then write this into a binary file. You would use this more for complex data structures that need to be stored and summoned. 

3.	In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?

  A. In python you can use the getcwd() function to view your working directory. If you wanted to change your current working directory you would use the chdir() function with the path you want to use inside the quotes.

4.	Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?

  A. If order to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error I would utilize "try-except" blocks, as they can continue your script and give specific and customizable error messages. 

5.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? Feel free to use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 

  A. I am really enjoying working through python so far, I am proud of the complexities and intracacies I have been able to comprehend in the teachings thus far. I am having trouble absorbing all of the information and need to look back alot to be able to complete these tasks. Functions and their structure continue to be my largest problem area in both JVS and Python.
