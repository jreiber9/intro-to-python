Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

●	Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
●	Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

A. 
Front end is working on the user side of an application, developing the features that the user will interact with. 
Back end is utlized for working on the server side of an application, the backend of a project connects the front end to apis, databases and servers.

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

A.
Both JS and Python utilize dynamic typing so that aspect of adjusting to the projects needs would be beneficial. Python also has built-in package management which allows for simplifying elaborate operations into condensed functions. Additional advantages are that it has great readability (easy to debug) and strong community support.


3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

A.
I want to learn the differences of syntax and intracacies of both python and js.
Allow learning aspects of python to reinforce the ability to have a greater understanding of the coding process.
I want to get more practice working with functions and the fundamentals of feature development for apps, to strengthen my understanding of coding in general.
