# exercise 1.2

## task

Create recipes with the following: 

    -name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
    -cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
    -ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I utilized Dictionaries as the structure for this task because of their ability to store values and objects while indexed by identifiers. The provided information seemed suitable to store as key/value pairs and dictionaries allow me to store multiple data types which is needed here.
