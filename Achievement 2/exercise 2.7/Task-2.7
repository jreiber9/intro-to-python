I plan to use the search for users to be able to look up a recipe and see it laid out in a table, click the name and be shown the details
If not they can click all recipes and see the list


Data visualization-

I used the line and bar charts to look at the cooking time distribution of mins for each recipe, and for the pie chart I showed a visualization of the ingredient distribution for each recipe. These can be found at the bottom of the all recipes page.
