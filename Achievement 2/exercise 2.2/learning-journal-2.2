Reflection Questions

1.	Suppose you’re in an interview. The interviewer gives you their company’s website as an example, asking you to convert the website and its different parts into Django terms. How would you proceed? For this question, you can think about your dream company and look at their website for reference. 
(Hint: In the Exercise, you saw the example of the CareerFoundry website in the Project and Apps section.)

2.	In your own words, describe the steps you would take to deploy a basic Django application locally on your system. 

3.	Do some research about the Django admin site and write down how you’d use it during your web application development.
