Reflection Questions

1.	Suppose you’re in an interview. The interviewer gives you their company’s website as an example, asking you to convert the website and its different parts into Django terms. How would you proceed? For this question, you can think about your dream company and look at their website for reference. 
(Hint: In the Exercise, you saw the example of the CareerFoundry website in the Project and Apps section.)
  A. I'll use my dream company NASA as the example - 
    In Django terms the NASA website would be considered the project. I would then consider the modules like - News&Events, NASA+Live, Explore, and      Multimedia - to be the apps.
2.	In your own words, describe the steps you would take to deploy a basic Django application locally on your system. 
  A. First I would create a specific virtual environment for this app, then install django on that environment. Then I would create the project with      the "django-admin.exe startproject" command. Then I would run the migrate(py manage.py migrate) and run server commands(py manage.py                 runserver). Finally I would check the localhost to confirm it was successfully launched.

3.	Do some research about the Django admin site and write down how you’d use it during your web application development.
  A. I will likely utilize this admin site to define models for the recipe app as well as leverage it to perform CRUD operations for the creation,        editing and deletion of certain certain elements within the app.
