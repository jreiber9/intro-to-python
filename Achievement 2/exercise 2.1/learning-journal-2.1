●	Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks 
●	Install and get started with Django

Reflection Questions

1.	Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
  A. The choice between using vanilla or django really depends on the projects complexity. Django offers rapid development, built-in features and community support, but it doesnt allow for for certain levels of control that a smaller app might require. Vanilla allows for more flexibility when building a project, but the manual setup required will slow down development for simpler projects.

2.	In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?
  A. The simplified handling of the controller aspects through the templent remove the need for an explicit controller. 

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
●	What do you want to learn about Django? 
  A. I want to learn how to quickly churn out apps with it. 
●	What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
  A. I'm hoping to continue to get more overall exporsure and practice coding in general.
●	Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
  A. I've heard that python is utilized a lot in the cybersecurity industry, which is what I've taken alot of interest in since I've began my coding journey.
