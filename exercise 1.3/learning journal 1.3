Exercise 1.3: Functions and Other Operations in Python
Learning Goals

●	Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
●	Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
●	Write functions to organize Python code

Reflection Questions

1.	In this Exercise, you learned how to use if-elif-else statements to run different tasks based on conditions that you define. Now practice that skill by writing a script for a simple travel app using an if-elif-else statement for the following situation: 

●	The script should ask the user where they want to travel. 
●	The user’s input should be checked for 3 different travel destinations that you define. 
●	If the user’s input is one of those 3 destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Enjoy your stay in ______!”
●	If the user’s input is something other than the defined destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Oops, that destination is not currently available.”
	
Write your script here. (Hint: remember what you learned about indents!)

location = input('Where would you like to travel to?: ')

if location == 'New Zealand':
	print('Enjoy your stay in New Zealand!')
elif location == 'Italy':
	print('Enjoy your stay in Italy!')
elif location == 'Iceland':
	print('Enjoy your stay in Iceland!')
else:
	print('Oops, that destination is not currently available.')





2.	Imagine you’re at a job interview for a Python developer role. The interviewer says “Explain logical operators in Python”. Draft how you would respond.

Logical operators are effective in dealing with values in python that can determine the logic in true and false statements. Examples of these are ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’.

3.	What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?

Functions are sets of instructions that process or manipulate your code in order to achieve certain things. 

4.	In the section for Exercise 1 in this Learning Journal, you were asked in question 3 to set some goals for yourself while you complete this course.  In preparation for your next mentor call, make some notes on how you’ve progressed towards your goals so far.

I believe that in learning through the basics of Python that it has helped me better understand the structure of both JS and PY. I do believe that my foundation of the structure of coding is strengthening throughout this process.
